The best way to set up a production and/or development server is to follow the steps from the mastodon docs which can be found here:
- [Production](https://mcole18.github.io/documentation/docs/admin/prerequisites/): start here and work your way through all the #Running Mastodon links.
- [Development](https://mcole18.github.io/documentation/docs/dev/setup/)

The documentation is an excellent resource for an overview of Mastodon, including code structure, routes, endpoints, entities, etc
