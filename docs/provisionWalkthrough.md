### Provisioning 

Provisioning is intended to follow this work flow:

- Go to `Preferences > Moderation > Invites` 
- def the values for:

| Name  | Description  |   
|---|---|
| Max number of users  | the max number of people who can use the invite link  |
| Expire after | the amount of time before the link expires  |
| Select group | the group that all users of the link will automatically join | 

- Click `Generate Invite Link`.
- Immediately copy the link and note which `Group` it belongs to. 
- Share the link with group members and assist them with filling out the registration form online.

example: ![generate_link](./img/generate_link.png)

### Verify success

- Once the link has been created and all users have registered, go to `Preferences > Follows and follwers`.
- From there, under `Relationship` click on `Followers`, you should see all the new users are following you.
- Verify that each users has the same amount of followers.  
 _Note: if any user logged out while other users registered the numbers may not perfectly match, however, when they log back in it will automatically update_
